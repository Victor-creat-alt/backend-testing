Step 1: Access PostgreSQL as the postgres superuser:
sudo -u postgres psql

Step 2: Create the database user 'victor' with a password:
CREATE USER victor WITH PASSWORD 'your_secure_password';

Step 3: Create the database 'vetty':
CREATE DATABASE vetty OWNER victor;

Step 4: Grant all privileges on the database to the user:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE vetty TO victor;

Step 5: Exit the psql prompt:
\q

Step 6: Update your alembic.ini and app config to use the new password in the connection string:
postgresql://victor:your_secure_password@localhost:5432/vetty

Step 7: Test the connection by running Alembic migration commands again:
flask db migrate -m 'created database'
flask db upgrade
