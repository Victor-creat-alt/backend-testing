Frontend Registration Fix Notes:

Issue:
- Backend expects a "name" field in the registration POST data.
- Frontend handleRegistration function was sending only email and password.
- This caused a 400 Bad Request error from the backend due to validation failure.

Fix:
- Update the frontend component's formData state initialization to include "name" with an empty string.
- Update the handleRegistration function to include the "name" field from formData in the POST data sent to the backend.
- This aligns the frontend data with backend expectations.
- No backend changes are required as it already maps "name" to "username" internally.

Summary of changes in the React component:
- Initialize formData state as:
  {
    name: '',
    email: '',
    password: '',
    otp: '',
  }
- In handleRegistration, send data as:
  {
    name: formData.name,
    email: formData.email,
    password: formData.password,
  }

This will resolve the 400 error on registration.
