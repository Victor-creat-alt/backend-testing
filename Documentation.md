## Assessment of Project Requirements Coverage

The backend-testing repository implements the core requirements for the veterinary e-commerce application:

- User authentication (login/register) is supported.
- Viewing all services and products is implemented.
- Cart functionality supports adding products and services with quantity management.
- Orders can be created from cart items.
- Service booking is supported via service requests.
- Payment integration with M-Pesa is implemented.
- Admin functionalities for managing services, products, orders, and service requests are present.
- Comprehensive tests cover critical backend functionality.

### Coverage Percentage Estimate: 95%

The backend-testing repo meets nearly all project demands. Minor improvements could include:

- Additional validation and error handling in some routes.
- More extensive test coverage for edge cases.
- Frontend integration and UI testing (outside backend scope).
